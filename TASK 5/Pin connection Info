Power Sources:
  Solar Panel (12V) with protection diode
  12V Battery backup with protection diode
  Both connected to relay module for power switching

Power Management:
  Relay module controlled by D3 pin of MCU
  Voltage regulator to step down 12V to 5V for MCU and logic

Sensing Components:
  Voltage divider from solar panel to A0 pin (ADC input)
  Analog counter connected to D2 pin
  Protection resistors and capacitors for clean signals

LED Control:
  MOSFET driver circuit connected to D6 pin
  LED array powered through MOSFET
  Current limiting resistors for LEDs

Key Implementation Notes:
  Use voltage divider for solar panel sensing (e.g., 10kΩ and 2kΩ resistors)
  Add decoupling capacitors near MCU power pins
  Include flyback diode across relay coil
  Use appropriate heat sinking for voltage regulator
  Add pull-down resistor on MOSFET gate
